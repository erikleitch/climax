\subsection{Sampling from multi-variate normal distributions with arbitrary correlations}

The multi-variate distribution is given by:

\begin{equation}
p(\bar{x}) = {1\over{(2\pi)^{k/2}{|\tilde{C}|}^{1/2}}}\,{\exp{-{1\over{2}}{(\bar{x} - \bar{\mu})^T\tilde{C}^{-1}{(\bar{x} - \bar{\mu})}}}}
\end{equation}

If we write out the terms of the exponent $M \equiv (\bar{x} - \bar{\mu})^T\tilde{C}^{-1}(\bar{x} - \bar{\mu})$
we have:

\begin{equation}
M = {x_k}^2 C_{kk} - 2x_k\mu_kC_{kk} + 2\sum_{i \neq k}{x_k(x_i - \mu_i)C_{ki}} + C_{kk}B_k
\end{equation}

where $B_k/C_{kk}$ represents all terms that don't depend on $x_k$. If we rewrite this as:

\begin{eqnarray}
M &=& C_{kk}{x_k}^2 + C_{kk}x_k\left(2\sum_{i \neq k}{(x_i - \mu_i)C_{ki}/C_{kk} - 2\mu_k}\right) + C_{kk}B_k\\
  &=& C_{kk}{x_k}^2 + C_{kk}x_kA_k + C_{kk}B_k\\
  &=& C_{kk}\left({x_k}^2 + x_kA_k + A_k^2/4\right) + C_{kk}\left(B_k - A_k^2/4\right) \\
  &=& C_{kk}\left(x_k + A_k/2\right)^2 + C_{kk}\left(B_k - A_k^2/4\right) 
\end{eqnarray}

we see that if $\mu_k^\prime \equiv -A_k/2$, the exponent can be written, up to a constant factor, as:

\begin{equation}
M_k = C_{kk}\left(x_k - \mu_k^\prime\right)^2.  
\end{equation}

We see then that up to a normalization, the conditional distribution for
$x_k$, $p(x_k|\{x_{i\neq k}\})$ is simply given by a univariate gaussian
with:

\begin{eqnarray}
\mu_k^\prime &=& -A_k/2 \\
\sigma_k   &=& 1/\sqrt{C_{kk}}
\end{eqnarray}

Our prescription for generating samples from the joint distribution is
then to Gibbs sample from the univariate conditional distributions,
starting from a random point, and iterating each time from the
previous point.  The result is itself a Markov chain which
collectively represents an unbiased sample from the joint
distribution.
