I have explored the GNFW model pretty extensively at this point, and
have encountered a number of issues with it:

\begin{list}{}{\labelwidth 0.4in \leftmargin \labelwidth \addtolength{\leftmargin}{\labelsep}}

\item[1] {The A10 and N07 normalizations don't agree, even for the same set of fit parameters}

\item[2] {For a given M500, the A10 normalization predicts a pressure
  (and therefore an SZ decrement) that is significantly lower than
  what we actually measure for real clusters thought to be close to that M500

  Another way of saying the same thing is that for a fixed SZ
  decrement, the GNFW model normalization predicts an M500 that is
  significantly larger than what you get from joint fits to SZ + Xray}

\item[3] {The A10 model is not self-consistent.  If you start with an
  M500 and use the A10 normalization to construct the corresponding
  pressure profile, the M500 that you get by integrating that pressure
  profile out to R500 does not agree with the M500 you started with}

\end{list}

In the next couple sections, I address each of these in turn.

\subsubsection{Comparing the A10 and N07 P500}

Substituting $f_B = 0.175, \mu = 0.59, \mu_e = 1.14, G = 6.67384\times 10^{-8} {\rm cm^{3}/(g\, s^2)}$, $h(z) \equiv H(z) / H_0$, we have

\begin{eqnarray}\nonumber
\P500 &=& {{\mu}\over{\mu_e}} f_B {{3}\over{8\pi}} \left( {{500 G^{-1/4} H(z)^2}\over{2}} \right)^{4/3}\M500^{2/3}\\\nonumber
      &=& (4197.54) \, H(z)^{8/3}\M500^{2/3}\\\nonumber
      &=& (4197.54) \, h(z)^{8/3}H_0^{8/3}\M500^{2/3}\\\nonumber
      &=& (4197.54) \, (70~{\rm km/s/Mpc})^{8/3}\,(3\times10^{14}\Msolar)^{2/3}\,h(z)^{8/3}h_{70}^{8/3}\left[{{\M500}\over{3\times10^{14}\Msolar}}\right]^{2/3}\\
      &=& 1.65\times10^{-3} \, h(z)^{8/3}h_{70}^{8/3}\left[{{\M500}\over{3\times10^{14}\Msolar}}\right]^{2/3} {\rm keV\,cm^{-3}}
\label{eq:arnaud}
\end{eqnarray}

This is to be compared to Eq~13 of A10, with which it agrees exactly.
I therefore conclude that there are no arithmetic errors in the
derivation of Arnaud's P500/M500 relationship.

Note that if we instead normalize \mathM500\ to
$1\times10^{15}\Msolar$, and take $h_{70} = 1$ or $h = 0.7$, as Nagai et al do, we
have:

\begin{equation}
\P500 = 5.89\times10^{-12} \, h(z)^{8/3}\left[{{\M500}\over{1\times10^{15}\Msolar}}\right]^{2/3} {\rm erg\,cm^{-3}}
\end{equation}

This is to be compared to Eq~3 of Nagai et al, with $h = 0.7$, which yields

\begin{equation}
\P500 = 1.14\times10^{-11} \, h(z)^{8/3}\left[{{\M500}\over{1\times10^{15}\Msolar}}\right]^{2/3} {\rm erg\,cm^{-3}}
\end{equation}

(Note that $h(z)$ is equivalent to the $E(z)$ of Nagai et al.  And N07
actually take $h = 0.72$, but I've used $h = 0.7$ for simplicity) 

The ratio of these two expressions is very close to 2, and the reason
is that N07 have dropped a factor of $h^2$ in their Eq~3, which
as-written is proportional to $h^{2/3}$ and not $h^{8/3}$, which is
clearly required by Eq~\ref{eq:p500}.  So that mystery amounts to
nothing more than typo in N07.

\subsubsection{Comparing P500 and M500}
\label{sec:confusion}

To make contact with $P_0$ of Equation~\ref{eq:ytop}, we have

\begin{eqnarray}
P_0 &=& p_0\times1.65\times10^{-3}h(z)^{8/3}\left[{\M500\over{3\times10^{14}h^{-1}_{70}\Msolar}}\right]^{2/3+\alpha_P}\,h^2_{70}\,{\rm keV\,cm^{-3}}
\label{eq:arnaudnorm}
\end{eqnarray}

(if we ignore $\alpha^\prime_P$).  This suggests, on the face of it,
that given a cosmology, we can relate an observed central decrement $y(0)$ to the Arnaud pressure normalization and therefore \mathM500\, by plugging $P_0$ into Equation~\ref{eq:ytop}.  However, I can't quite make sense of the numbers I get if I attempt to do this.  

Let's take Abell~1914 as a test case.  This cluster has a redshift $z
= 0.168$, which yields $h(z) = 1.089$ and $D_A = 0.59$~Gpc.  For A1914, the central
decrement is roughly $-2$~mK, or $y(0) \sim 4\times 10^{-4}$.  The Arnaud fits
give a typical $\theta_c\sim 2^{\,\prime}$, yielding:

\begin{equation}
P_0 = 0.29~{\rm keV/cm^3}
\end{equation}

from Equation~\ref{eq:ytop}.  Plugging the numbers into Equation~\ref{eq:arnaudnorm}, we have:

\begin{equation}
P_0 = 1.74\times 10^{-2}\left[{\M500\over{3\times10^{14}\Msolar}}\right]^{2/3+\alpha_P}~{\rm keV/cm^3},
\end{equation}

or

\begin{equation}
\M500 = 1\times10^{16}\Msolar
\end{equation}

which seems about an order of magnitude too large (estimates of the virial mass for A1914 I've seen are somewhere in the neighborhood of $2-3\times10^{15}\Msolar$).

\subsubsection{The A10 Model is not Self-consistent}

As noted above, if you start with an M500, you can use
Eq~\ref{eq:arnaud} to determine \mathP500\ and thus the normalization of
the cluster pressure profile, via Eq~\ref{eq:ytop}, in particular:

\begin{equation}\nonumber
P(r) = \P500\,p(r).
\end{equation}

where $p(r)$ is the GNFW profile in Eq~\ref{eq:gnfw}.  

This suggests that if the cluster were an isothermal sphere, then
$P(\R500)/\P500 = p(\R500) = 1.0$.  For A10's parameter values,
however, $p(\R500) = 0.48$ (which is suspiciously close to the ratio
of $(70/100)^2$).  It is also consistent with my empirical observation
that the \mathP500\ normalization predicts an SZ decrement that is
about a factor of 2 smaller than observed, for a set of clusters for
which we have independent SZ + X-ray mass estimates.

From Eq~\ref{eq:ysph} and Eq~\ref{eq:mgas} we also have:

\begin{eqnarray}
\M500 &=& {1\over{f_{gas}}}\left({{m_p\mu_e}\over{k_B T_e}}\right)\integral{\R500}{0}{P(r)}{V}\\
&=& {1\over{f_{gas}}}\left({{m_p\mu_e}\over{k_B T_e}}\right)\P500\,p_0\integral{\R500}{0}{p(r)}{V}
\end{eqnarray}

If I take measured X-ray temperatures for a set of clusters and the
A10 pressure profile fits, I can integrate this expression and
compare it to what the A10 normalization would predict for \mathM500,
and again I find that the masses I obtain in this manner are factors
of ~several lower than the best-fit \mathM500.  

All of which suggests that an appropriate way to proceed with my
simulations is to rescale $p_0$ to force self-consistency with the
input \mathM500.  That is, I find the value of $p_0$ that gives me the
same integrated \mathM500\ that I put in the model in the first place.
This factor is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rescale}.
