\subsubsection{Beta Model (\betamodel)}

The \betamodel\ is an analytic shape function widely used in X-ray
analysis to fit the radial density profile:

\begin{equation}
n_e(x) = {{n_e}_0\over{\left[1 + x^2\right]^{(3\beta/2)}}}
\end{equation}

The line-integral of this function is therefore commonly used to fit the
projected 2D cluster profiles in SZ observations:

\begin{equation}
p(x) = {1\over{\left[1 + x^2\right]^{(1-3\beta/2)}}}
\end{equation}

The \betamodel\ can bs used in \climax\ by invoking \code{addmodel}
with \code{type = betamodel}.
